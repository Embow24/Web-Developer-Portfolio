      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>I am a dedicatied, motivated individual who enjoys a challenge. After obtaining a university degree in the education sector I spent three years teaching in a primary school. During this time I taught multiple year groups comupter safety and how to use coding software such as scratch. This sparked my interest in understanding what goes into creating a webpage and therefore I am now currently developing my own coding skills through a Frontend Web Developer bootcamp course.</p>
    <p>My goal is to become confident in web development and support companies in designing accessible, functional webpages that cater for all of their consumers. I aim to become knowledgable in using web development software such as HTML, CSS and JacaScript to name a few. Due to my good organisational and teamwork skills, along with a good eye for detail, I feel confident that with hard work I could develop great skills for this field of work. </p>
